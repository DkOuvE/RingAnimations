# RingAnimations
Fork of WojciechBednarski/NeopixelMarlinSlave. This is an Arduino sketch for utilizing second arduino with i2c to drive neopixel 24 pixel ring for Marlin firmware for my CR10.

The plan is to create fluid animations that fade to black between them.

# Libraries Needed
- Adafruit_NeoPixel
- NeoPixelBus_by_Makuna library
