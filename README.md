# RingAnimations
This is an Arduino sketch for utilizing a second arduino with i2c to drive a 24 pixel Neopixel ring for Marlin firmware for my CR10.

The plan is to create fluid animations that fade to black between them. Marlin 2.0.x integration can be found in DkOuvE/Marlin.

# Libraries Needed
- Adafruit_NeoPixel
- NeoPixelBus_by_Makuna library
